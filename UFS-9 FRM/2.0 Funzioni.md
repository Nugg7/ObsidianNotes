### Tipi Primitivi
---
Stringhe, Numeri, Booleani sono considerati variabili primitivi e quando copiati, vengono copiati i valori.

We can also define a set of values in which, instead of having integer as a type, we can limit which values can be assigned to what.

It is really useful when you want to use integers to represent a certain state or a certain value, but you want to give them a name to make the code more readable.
e.g.

Without ENUMS:

```cpp
int A = 0;
int B = 1;
int C = 2;
...
int main(){
	int value = B;
	if(value == B){
		// code...
	}
	std::cin.get();
}
```

With ENUMS:

```cpp
...
enum Example{
	A, B, C
};
...
int main(){
	Example value = A;
	// I cannot put another number or variable in value
	// since it is a enum variable and accepts only the values inside the ENUM
	if(value == B){
		// code...
	}
	// though we can still check with value == 5 in the if
	std::cin.get();
}
```

If we don't assign any values in the ENUM, it will, by default, assign from left to right incremental integers from 0, since it is a 32 bit integer by default. *(we can specify where to start from, assigning to the first variable the number where we want to start).* 

We can assign a type to the ENUM by specifying the type after the name of the ENUM with a ':'. e.g. `enum Example : unsigned char`.

Though we can't assign something like a `float`, since the ENUM has to be an Integer, and making it an unsigned char, it will be more efficient since the unsigned char is practically an 8 bit Integer.

In doing so we can actually change the `LogLevels` in the previous Class of `Log.h` to ENUM values.

>[!WARNING]
>Avoid having values in the ENUM (if in a Class) that could have the same name as a function, since when used in the Main, we will use `ClassName::ValueInEnum`, and it will go in conflict with any method with the same name in the Class.

A Pure Virtual Function is what we know as interfaces or abstract functions in other languages, like Java and C#.

It allows us to create functions without a body in a base class, so that we can enforce other derived classes to implement these functions, and define a body for them. They just act as templates for other classes to modify and implement in their way.

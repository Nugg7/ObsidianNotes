### Definition
---
A Pure Virtual Function is what we know as interfaces or abstract functions in other languages, like Java and C#.

It allows us to create functions without a body in a base class, so that we can enforce other derived classes to implement these functions, and define a body for them. They just act as templates for other classes to modify and implement in their way.
### Usage
---
To use a pure virtual function, you need to declare a normal class and then declare functions with virtual, but give them the value of 0.
e.g.

```cpp
//...
class Log{
	virtual void logger(std::string str) = 0;
}
//...
class Other : public Log{
	void logger override (std::string str){
		// code
	}
}
```

Giving the function a value of 0 makes it a pure function, then we just need to override the function in the derived classes and that's it. Obviously like every other interfaces, in other programming languages like Java, you need to override the function inside the interface, otherwise it will give an error.

>[!INFO]
>Unlike in Java, C++ is able to have multi-inheritance and it does not distinguish if the class is an interface or a normal class, you still use `:` for both of them.

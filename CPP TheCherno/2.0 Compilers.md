### Compiling in VS
---
In C++ the compilation part of the project can be executed separately from the running of the application, at least from what I'm used to in Java where i just compile and run at the same time with an IDE.

In C++ compiling is a really important part of the project, since it will be the fundamental tool to create an application with C++. In Visual studio the compiling part is already automated with a button and has a lot of settings and configurations, there is the type of OS you are compiling for, (e.g. Win32/64, Mac, Linux, ...) then there are the modes they compile for: 
- **Debugger mode**: a lot slower but way more forgiving and gives essential errors that sometimes in Optimized mode are not seen.
- **Optimized mode**: a lot faster and in the binary you can see that most of superfluous code is cut in half or completely deleted by the compiler.
### Compiling in g++

Compiling in Linux with g++ is way easier, but with way less options: 
- you can just compile
- you don't have any options or configuration (as of where I am with the learning process from the playlist of $The\space Cerno$).
- there are 2 ways of compiling in g++.

The main way of compiling in g++ is to just $$g++\space [name\space of\space files]\space -o\space [executable]$$This is really easy and fast, but the caveat is the fact that it will be slower for the computer, it will need to recompile every file every single time you make the smallest changes in a single file.

The second way of compiling a project is to:
$$g++\space -c\space [cpp\space files]\space -o \space[same\space name\space of\space cpp\space files\space but\space .out]$$
then 
$$g++\space *.out\space -o\space [executable]$$
This way you can just recompile the single file that you modified making it faster and more efficient, but harder (more code to write).

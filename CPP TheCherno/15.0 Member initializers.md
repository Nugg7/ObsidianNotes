### Definition
---
It is a way to initialize our class member functions in the constructor, and to do that there are 2 ways that we can use.
### Usage
---
```cpp
class Entity{
private:
	std::string m_Name;
public:
	Entity(){
		m_Name = "Unknown";
	}
	Entity(const std::string& name){
		m_Name = name;
	}
	const std::string& getName() const { return m_Name; }
}
//...
int main(){
	Entity ent;
	std::cin.get();
}
```

This is how we would initialize our class in the main in other programming languages and before in C++. 

But there are other ways to do this.
e.g.

```cpp
class Entity{
private:
	std::string m_Name;
	int m_Score;
public:
	Entity() : m_Name("Unkown"), m_Score(0){}
	Entity(const std::string& name) : m_Name(name){}
	const std::string& getName() const { return m_Name; }
}
//...
int main(){
	Entity ent;
	std::cin.get();
}
```

This way we can initialize the class' member variables after `:` with the values inside the `()`.

>[!WARNING]
>Always initialize the member variables in the order they were defined in the class, otherwise it will create all sorts of dependencies issues. That's because the compiler will initialize member variables in the order they are declared. (in some compilers they will even warn you)

The reason why you use this way of initializing member variables is because, if you use the normal way of initializing member variables, the compiler will actually initializing twice: firstly with the default initializer and then again with the parameter we've given it, making it a waste of performance.

### Definition
---
It is one of the fundamentals of $OOP$, and one of the most important and useful functionality of inheritance, is the fact that we can create a hierarchy of classes. 

Essentially it allows us to have a base class (parent) which contains common functionalities, allowing us to then branch off from the base class to create sub-classes which use those common functionalities in those derived classes.

The primary reason of why this is so useful is the fact that it allows us to avoid code duplication.
### Usage
---
To make a class inherit a base class, you need to put beside the name of your class `: public BaseClass`. (*Just like in C#*)
e.g.

```cpp
class BaseClass{
	// code...
}

class DerivedClass : public BaseClass{
	// code...
}
```

Their use is basically the same as the one in Java, making something like polymorphism possible even in C++.

In C++ you can see the size of objects just by using the function `sizeof(elem);`, and we can see that, whenever the derived class inherits the base class, the base class occupies more memory since it inherits even the member variables in the base class.

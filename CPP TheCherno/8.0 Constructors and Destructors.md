### Constructors
---
Constructors are special methods that run every time we instantiate objects from a Class.

They work exactly the same way as constructors in Java
e.g.

```cpp
...
class Entity{
public:
	int X, Y;
	
	Entity(){
		X = 0.0f;
		Y = 0.0f;
	}
	
	Entity(float x, float y){
		X = x;
		Y = y;
	}

	void Print(){
		std::cout << "X: " << X << ", Y: " << Y << std::endl;
	}
};
...
int main(){
	Entity e(12.1f, 34.2f);
	e.Print();
	std::cin.get();
}
```

If we want a class that only has static methods, like a Log to write and print, then we can hide or delete completely the Constructor so that users cannot instantiate the Class.
e.g.

```cpp
class Log{
	//either private it
	//private:
		//Log() {}
	//or completely delete it
	Log() = delete;	
};
```
### Destructor
---
Similarly to Constructors, which runs, when you create a new instance of a class, Destructors run when you destroy an object. So we use them when we need to un-initialize variables or elements of an objects, or want to free the memory. We call the Destructor whenever we use the keyword `delete`.
e.g.

```cpp
...
class Entity{
public:
	int X, Y;
	
	Entity(){
		X = 0.0f;
		Y = 0.0f;
	}
	
	Entity(float x, float y){
		X = x;
		Y = y;
	}
	
	~Entity(){
		std::cout << "[Destroyed Entity]" << std::endl;	
	}
	
	void Print(){
		std::cout << "X: " << X << ", Y: " << Y << std::endl;
	}
};
...
int main(){
	Entity e(12.1f, 34.2f);
	e.Print();
	std::cin.get();
}
```

We define a Destructor with a ~ before the name of the class, similarly to the Constructor.

*There is no need to free the memory from X and Y since we allocate them locally in the class. (don't know what that means, he will explain in later videos).*

And since the object is stack allocated, the destructor will only be called at the end of the program. But if we put the Object's operation in a function and we call that function in the Main, then we can see that the Object will be destroyed at the end of the function.

```cpp
...
void Function(){
	Entity e(12.1f, 34.2f);
	e.Print();
}
...
int main(){
	Function();
	std::cin.get();
}
```

```terminal
> ./Out/Program
> X: 12.1, Y: 34.2
> [Destroyed Entity]
> | // line: std::cin.get();
```

We can also call the Destructor manually as if it was a normal method:
`e.~Entity();`.

### Creation
---
It is easier to read if you divide the various element of a class in different sections:
- public attributes
- private attributes
- public methods
- public static methods
- etc...
e.g.

```cpp
...
class Log{
public:
	const int LogLevelError = 0;
	const int LogLevelWarning = 1;
	const int LogLevelInfo = 2;
private:
	int m_LogLevel = LogLevelInfo; 
	// m_ is to tell that that variable is a class member variable that's private. (just for readability)
public:
	void SetLevel(int level){
		m_LogLevel = level;
	}
	
	void Warn(const char* message){
		std::cout << "[WARNING]:" << message << std::endl;
	}

	void Error(const char* message){
		std::cout << "[ERROR]:" << message << std::endl;
	}

	void Info(const char* message){
		std::cout << "[INFO]:" << message << std::endl;
	}
};
...
int main(){
	Log log;
	log.setLevel(LogLevel);
	log.level("Hello!");
	
	std::cin.get();
}
```
### Actual Creation
---
Firstly you create a project, probably structured this way, to make things easier: 
e.g.

```
+-- DevProject
|   +-- src
|   |   +-- HeaderFiles
|   |   |   +-- LogHeader.h
|   |   +-- Out
|   |   |   +-- Executable
|   |   +-- Main.cpp
|   |   +-- Log.cpp
|	+-- CMakeLists.txt
+
```

After that you create the actual Class in the header file: `LogHeader.h`, in which you define only the prototype of the methods and member variables/attributes.
e.g.

```cpp
#pragma once
#include <iostream>

class Log{
public:
	const int LogLevelError = 0;
	const int LogLevelWarning = 1;
	const int LogLevelInfo = 2;
private: 
	int m_LogLevel = LogLevelInfo;
	// we use m_ for variables that we know are private
public: 
	void setLevel(int level);
	void Info(const char *message);
	// other methods...
}
```

Then we go in the actual `Log.cpp` file and, first we include the header file by using `#include "HeaderFiles/LogHeader.h"`, and then define everything that's not defined, so the methods.
e.g.

```cpp
#include "HeaderFiles/LogHeader.h"

Log::setLevel(int level){
	m_LogLevel = level;
}
Log::Info(const char *message){
	std::cout << "[INFO]: " << message << std::endl;
}
// other methods...
```

>[!WARNING]
>It is really important to declare which class method's body we are defining in the `cpp` file, and we do that by putting the name of the class before the method and link them with `::`, such as the e.g. on top.

After that we include the same header file in `Main.cpp`, and we will be able to use every method and attribute we set as public or protected in the class.
e.g.

```cpp
#include "HeaderFiles/LogHeader.h"

int main(){
	Log log;
	log.setLevel(log.LogLevelInfo);
	log.Info("Hello this is and Info!");
	
	std::cin.get();
}
```

Finally the final step is to link them with your compiler, in this case `g++`: (there is no need to compile header files).
e.g.

```terminal
cd 'path to src/'
g++ -c Main.cpp Log.cpp 
ls 
	HeaderFiles/ Main.cpp Main.o Log.cpp Log.o Out/
g++ *.o -o Out/Program
ls Out
	Program
./Out/Program
```

And Just like that you created a simple project with classes.

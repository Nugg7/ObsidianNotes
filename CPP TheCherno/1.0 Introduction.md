### Abstraction and Language Level
---
C++ is a low level language, that means that it operates on the level of the hardware, whereas Java is a high level language that has many levels of abstraction between the user and the hardware.
### Various quirks
---
C++ on the contrary of Java has many differentiations like the static keyword (it has a different meaning in Java and C++), or maybe the way classes/files work and ultimately how I'm trying to learn it, without an IDE, instead of Java when I learnt it in high school.
### Conclusion
---
In conclusion I still have many things that I'm trying to learn and these are just a few things I learnt during the course of $The\space Cherno$. The most important that i still need to revisit IMO is the setting up of the project in $CMake$ for g++ to compile.

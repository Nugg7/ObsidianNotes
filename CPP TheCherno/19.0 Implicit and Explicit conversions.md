Implicit means essentially doing something without someone telling it what to do, so automatic (in this context). So whenever you are telling C++ to convert a data type to another, if there is already a function to do that with those 2 data types, C++ will convert those implicitly.
e.g.

```cpp
class Entity {
private:
	std::string m_Name;
	int m_Age;
public:
	Entity()
		:m_Name("Kim Jong-un"), m_Age(99){}
	Entity(const std::string& name)
		:m_Name(name), m_Age(-1){}
	Entity(int age)
		:m_Age(age), m_Name("Unknown"){}
};

void printEnt (const Entity& ent){
	//printing...
}

int main(){
	Entity a = "Marcus";
	Entity b = 22;
	
	printEnt(69);
}
```

In this case the compiler in C++ is actually not gonna give an error, since it is implicitly converting `"Marcus"` and `22` into an `Entity` instance, because there is a constructor with those parameters.

Just like with the `printEnt` function, the compiler is implicitly casting `69` into an entity with the constructor that takes an int as a parameter.

But if you use the function with a string, it will not work.
e.g.

```cpp
printEnt("Jhonny");
//this will give you an error since "Jhonny" is not a std::string, but a char array.
```

To make this work the compiler would need to do 2 implicit conversions, but it can only do 1 at a time for a variable. So we are the ones who would need to do one of the conversions
e.g.

```cpp
printEnt(std::string("Jhonny"));
// or
printEnt(Entity("Jhonny"));
```

Though I would actually use the `Entity ent(21)` way of creating an instance of the class, since it is easier to read and understand.
### Explicit
---
This keyword on the other hand, completely disable this functionality. It is used on the constructors and whenever you use the `explicit` keyword you are effectively telling the compiler 'NO implicit conversions'.
e.g.

```cpp
class Entity {
private:
	std::string m_Name;
	int m_Age;
public:
	Entity()
		:m_Name("Kim Jong-un"), m_Age(99){}
	Entity(const std::string& name)
		:m_Name(name), m_Age(-1){}
	explicit Entity(int age)
		:m_Age(age), m_Name("Unknown"){}
};

void printEnt (const Entity& ent){
	//printing...
}

int main(){
	Entity a = "Marcus";
	Entity b = 22; //this will not work
	
	printEnt(69); //this will not work
	//you will need to use either one of these
	Entity b(22);
	Entity b = Entity(22);
}
```

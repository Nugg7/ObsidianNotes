They are just a way to write if else in a simpler and faster way.
### Usage
---
The normal way we would do this is: 

```cpp
int main() {
	int s_Level = 1;
	int s_Speed = 2;
	
	if (s_Level > 5)
		s_Speed = 10;
	else{
		s_Speed = 5;
	}
}
```

While using ternary operations we can make this instruction, way faster and more compact.
e.g.

```cpp
int main() {
	int s_Level = 1;
	int s_Speed = 2;
	
	s_Speed = s_Level > 5 ? 10 : 5;
}
```

And technically when using this method with new variables like a string, it is faster and more efficient.
e.g.

```cpp
int main() {
	int s_Level = 1;
	int s_Speed = 2;
	
	std::string ex = s_Level > 5 ? 10 : 5;
	
	std::string otherEx;
	if(s_Level > 10)
		otherEx = "higher"
	else
		otherEx = "lower"	
}
```

>That is because, whenever using the if method, we are instantiating the variable with a default constructor and then overwriting the value to either higher or lower. Instead with ternary operators we are able to instantiate the variable directly with the value higher or lower and the reason it does that is because it is using the **return value optimization**. (we will talk about it in the future)

We can also nest ternary operators, but it is not advised because it actually makes the code more confusing.
e.g.

```cpp
int main() {
	int s_Level = 1;
	int s_Speed = 2;
	s_Speed = s_Level > 5 ? s_Level > 10 ? 15 : 10 : 5;
}
```

Making the ternary operator effectively a if-else-elseif statement, with 15 being the truthy value of `s_Level > 10`, 10 the truthy value of `s_Level > 5` and 5 the else value;

And if you use `&&` or other operators there is no need to put the conditions between parenthesis because the compiler executes the other conditions only after confronting the conditions with these operators.

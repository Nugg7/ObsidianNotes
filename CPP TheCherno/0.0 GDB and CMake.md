### CMake set up for debugging
To debug a C++ file you need to add these lines in the `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE Debug)
set(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE RelWithDebInfo)
```

Then go into the debug directory and run this command

```terminal
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug <path and other arguments>
```

and finally build the debug directory.

```terminal
cmake --build .
```
### GDB debugging
---
When using `GDB`, you need to type:

```terminal
gdb <executable file path>
```

You will be able to run this command only with files that have been compiled in debug mode from a compiler that `gdb` can understand. (such as `CMake`).

Commands: 
- **lay next** -> outputs the layout of your code (click enter a few times to view all of your layout)
- **break main** -> puts a break point at the start of your main
- **run** -> runs the debugger from the break point
- **next** -> jumps to the next line of the source code / step over
- **nexti** -> jumps to the next line of the assembly
- **step** -> step into
- **ref** -> refreshes the page, since whenever we output something it messes up the interface sometimes
- **x/i $pc** -> examine/view memory in the instruction at pc
- **info registers** -> gets the state of the registers of the program
- **delete N** -> deletes the breakpoint N
- **p variable** -> prints variable value
- **print $reg** -> prints the value register selected
- **print/x $reg** -> prints the value in hex
- **x/s address** -> prints the value inside the address specified in string format
- **x/t address** -> prints the value inside the address specified in binary format
- **clear** -> deletes all breakpoints

A pointer is just a variable that holds an address that indicates in which cell of memory the value is stored. It is type-less, the fact that we assign types to them is only a way to make things easier for us.

We assign types to pointers only to make the source code easier to read for us and say that presumably the type which is stored in that cell of memory is of the type we assigned to the pointer. But for all we care the pointers of the program can all be declared as void.

But the types are also useful when reassigning values in the cell of memory of the pointer, cause if that pointer variable is void, then the compiler does not know how many bytes to write, since it's a void, but when we assign a type to it, then the compiler knows what value to expect in the pointer address.

```cpp
int a = 8;
int *p_a = &a;
// creating variables and pointers in the stack

char *buffer = new char[8];
// this is creating an array of chars in the heap
// char whilst being 1 byte of memory this command asks for 8
// so in the pointer is storing an address that points at thi beginning of a block of memory of 8 bytes.

memset(buffer, 0, 8);
// memset is a command that fills a specific block of memory // memset(addressOfBM, whatToFIll, numberOfBytesOfTheBM);    // BM = Block of memory                                      // IMPORTANT: to use it, import cstring header, otherwise this will break your head 

delete[] buffer;
// frees the block of memory from the heap

size_t bufferSize = sizeof(buffer);                                                            
printf("buffer address: %p\nsize: %zu bytes\n", buffer, bufferSize);                           
// %p is used for pointers                                   // %z is for size_t                                          // %zu is for size_t unsigned
```
### Stack vs Heap

Variables created in the heap, instead of the stack, can be deleted (`delete(operator) variable;`) freeing the heap and making more memory available to the program.

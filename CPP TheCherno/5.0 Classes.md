### Definition
---
Classes are used for $OOP$ - Object Oriented Programming, this is a style of coding that's become really popular in the programming industry, and it is not supported in some languages like C because you need the concepts of Classes, abstraction and inheritance, which are not available in C, but C++ implements them. (that's why C++ is called  C++ - +adds other new features).
### Usage
---
Just like in other $OOP$s like Java or C#, Classes are used mostly to serve as a blueprint to define the structure of objects and their functionalities.

```cpp
...
class Player{
	public: 
		int x, y;
		int speed;
};
...
int main(){
	Player player;
	player.speed = 3;
}
```

In this code we created the class `Player` and we created an object of that class. An object is an instance of the class so, essentially, we instantiated an object of the class `Player`, and after, we assigned the value 3 to the attribute `speed`. 

We are able to assign the value 3 to a variable that would normally not be visible in the main function, because we assigned the access modifier `public` to those variables, making their scope available in the entire project.

Other accessibility modifiers: 
- private: set as default, makes it accessible inside the class
- protected: makes it accessible only in the same class (like with private) but also by sub-classes (derived classes).
### Functions
---
The class we created can also have functionalities, like move for instance. 

```cpp
...
class Player{
	public: 
		int x = 0;
		int y = 0;
		int speed;

	void Move(int xa, int ya){
		x += xa;
		y += ya;
	}
};
...
int main(){
	Player player;
	player.speed = 3;
}
```

These functions have to be defined inside our class to work and to access them we need to use:

```cpp
int main(){
	Player player;
	player.speed = 3;

	player.Move(3, 5);
}
```

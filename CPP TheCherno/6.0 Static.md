### Definition
---
This keyword has a different meaning in C++, rather than Java, and changes meaning on the context in which it is used: when used inside or outside of a Class/Struct.

**Outside**: means that the linkage of that symbol you declared as static will be visible only in that translation unit. *$TLDR$: whatever you put after static will only be visible in that `cpp` file.*

**Inside**: means that that variable you declared as `static` will share memory across all instances of that Class, similarly to what happens to the methods of that Class. *(The same as Java)*
### Usage - Outside Class/Struct
---
Usually it is a better practice to name the variables that are going to be static with an `s_` for readability. And it is better used to create global variables with the scope defined only in that translation unit, so that if we create other variables in other files, the linker won't have problems.
e.g.

```cpp 
// file 1
int s_var = 1;

// Main.cpp
...
int s_var = 4;
...
int main(){
	// code ...
}

// this will cause a LNK error since s_var is already
// defined in the other file

// solution: 

//file 1
static int s_var = 1;
```

Another way to avoid this error, without using the static keyword, is using the `extern` keyword. It makes the linker look for that variable in other translation units.

```cpp
// file 1
int s_var = 3;

// Main.cpp
...
extern int s_var;
// this is external linkage or external linking
// since this makes the variable reference the one in the
// other file
...
int main(){
	// code ...
}
```

This is not exclusive to variables only, but also applies to functions.

### Definition
---
This keyword has a different meaning in C++, rather than Java, and changes meaning on the context in which it is used: when used inside or outside of a Class/Struct.

**Outside**: means that the linkage of that symbol you declared as static will be visible only in that translation unit. *$TLDR$: whatever you put after static will only be visible in that `cpp` file.*

**Inside**: means that that variable you declared as `static` will share memory across all instances of that Class, similarly to what happens to the methods of that Class. *(The same as Java)*
### Usage - Outside Class/Struct
---
Usually it is a better practice to name the variables that are going to be static with an `s_` for readability.

### Definition

It has 2 Main uses, 1 with the keyword const (like explained in [[14.0 Const]]) and 1 with Lambdas.

When we talk about Mutable in the context of Const then it is used to almost reverse the effects of Const, meaning that we are actually able to change the variable even if the scope we are working in, is const. 
### Usage - member variables
---
So if we have a const method in a class and a mutable variable outside the method, we can actually make modifications to the mutable variable; This it is actually the most used way to use mutable.*(another way is to make the variable global, but that's not really a good way to go around the const)*
### Usage - lambdas
---
When using it with lambdas, it is practically the same in the sense that we are able to use the variable in the lambda, since you have to pass the variable to the lambda if you want to use it inside it. 

But, more importantly, when saving the lambda inside a function (like on JavaScript) you would have to save the variable in a local one first, and then make changes on it, but it is going to make a local copy of that variable and use that, so it is not going to change the real variable.

```cpp
int main(){
	int a = 23;
	auto f = [=]() mutable { // the value = can be changed to &a
		x++;
		std::cout << x << std::endl;
	}
	f();
}
```

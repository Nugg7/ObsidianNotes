### Definition
---
They are really important to the concepts like inheritance, $OOP$, $polymorphism$, and functional programming; because they allow you to override methods in sub-classes.

If you create an object as a pointer that equals `new className()`, you are effectively creating an object dynamically, making it possible to be able to destroy with `delete`.
Not only that, but to access its methods, you will need to use `->` instead of the normal `.`.
### Usage
---
Virtual is nothing but a keyword, like static, that allows you to use $polymorphism$. In fact without using virtual, whenever creating a variable as a father class, but assigning a child type object into it, it will still use the methods of the father class. To be able to override those methods, we need to put `virtual` on the method we want to override, and `override` in the overridden method of the child class.
e.g.

```cpp
//father.cpp
class{
	//code...
	virtual void func(){
		//code...
	}
};
//child.cpp
class{
	//code...
	void func() override {
		//overridden code...
	}
};
```

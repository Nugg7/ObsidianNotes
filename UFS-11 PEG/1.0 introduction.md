- Chief People Officer (CPO)

**Teams:**
Team effectiveness is ART, there isn’t any silver bullet; there are a lot of great ideas and examples but every context/product/company has to face this topic and find their way.
**Common principles**
- divide et impera (aka “sub startups)
- cross functional teams (every team MUST operate their processes end to end)
- data driven (define KPIs aligned with business goals and assess them with real data)

**Startup business plans:**
Every business plan come with some assumptions about
- EBITDA: Earnings Before Interests Taxes Depreciation and Amortization
- CAPEX (acquisto di asset con un ammortamento lungo, anche difficile da comprare e vendere - sono piu' difficili da tagliare e copiare): money an organization or corporate entity spends to buy, maintain, or improve its fixed assets
- OPEX (spese operative, che sono continue per l'operazione dell'azienda come: stipendi, carta da stampante, etc... - sono piu' facili da tagliare e copiare): ongoing cost for running a product, business, or system
- Competitor analysis: there is always a competitor
- Market analysis: which is and how much broad is the addressable market
- Financial plan (quanti soldi devo prendere in prestito): how and when funds will be raised (e.g. VC rounds or debt)

2. the startup began profitable and doing so it’s able to stand without raising funds

### Avvento 4
---
The chief historian is nowhere to be found, so we go to the next destination: Ceres monitoring station.
#### Problem
In a crossword we have to find the work `XMAS`, this word has to be found in the puzzle input both horizontally, vertically, diagonally, written backwards or when overlapped on other words.
Ex.
```
MMMSXXMASM
MSAMXMSMSA
AMXSXMAAMM
MSAMASMSMX
XMASAMXAMM
XXAMMXXAMA
SMSMSASXSS
SAXAMASAAA
MAMMMXMMMM
MXMXAXMASX
```

```
....XXMAS.
.SAMXMS...
...S..A...
..A.A.MS.X
XMASAMX.MM
X.....XA.A
S.S.S.S.SS
.A.A.A.A.A
..M.M.M.MM
.X.X.XMASX
```

And so we need to find how many times it appears.
#### Solution
Divide the block of characters into a 2 dimensional matrix and fill every cell with a character, then check for every characters horizontally, vertically, diagonally, and for each way its reverse, the next characters and if they spell `XMAS`.
### Part 2
---
Dipshit actually fucked the instructions and I was actually needed to find `MAS` in the form of an X so:

```
M.S
.A.
M.S
```
#### Solution
Whenever you find an 'A', check both diagonal ways if we can spell `MAS`.

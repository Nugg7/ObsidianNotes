### Introduction
---
Visual basic is also an OOP - Object Oriented Programming language.
It is really similar to other programming languages but it has its quirks, for example it does not use any other type of parenthesis other than the normal ones (so there are no {} or []) and there are no `;` to close the definition of the line of code.

```vb
Module MyModule
	Sub Main()
		Dim name As String  ' declaration of a variable
		name = Console.ReadLine("Type your name") 
		' similar to python it can ask for an input from the user
		' while also printing out a text for the user

		Console.WriteLine("Hi, your name is " & name) ' print to console
	End Sub
End Module
```
### Declarations and Types
---
```vb
Module MyModule
	Sub Main()
		Dim ch As Char = 'A'C ' chars
		Dim bool As Boolean = True ' boolean
		Dim i As Integer = 3 ' integer
		Dim s As Single = 5.2F ' single (float) - 4 bytes
		Dim d As Double = 9.2 ' double - 8 bytes
	End Sub
End Module
```
### Expressions and Operators
---
```vb
Option Strict On
Option Explicit On
' equivalent of 'using System;' in C#

Module MyModule
	Sub Main()
		Dim i as Integer = 12 \ 6 
		' the operator to divide integers \
		Dim r as Integer = 13 Mod 6 ' equivalent of %
		Dim d as Double = 13 / 6 ' operator for normal divisions
		Dim p as Double = 2 ^ 6 ' Math.pow(2, 6)
		
		Dim b as Boolean = i = 3 
		' this should be: bool b = i == 3;
		' but in VB it is an illegal operation
		' comparisons are done with only one =
		Dim bo as Boolean, Dim bo2 as Boolean ' default is false
		bo = bo2 = true 
		' this should be: bo = bo2 = true, 
		' outcome: bo = true, bo2 = true

		' but in VB c becomes false
	End Sub
End Module
```

In the last instruction, in C# we are effectively assigning true to both `bo` and `bo2`, while in VB we are assigning to `bo` the result of the operation `bo2 == true`, but since there hadn't been assigned any value, as default it had been assigned a false value making the result of the operation `false`.

```vb
Option Strict On
Option Explicit On

Module MyModule
	Sub Main()
		Dim i as Integer = 2, r as Integer = 1 
		If i <> 3 Then 
			Console.WriteLine("Not OK") ' equivalent of != 
		End If
		If Not i = 3 Then
			Console.WriteLine("OK") ' equivalent of !(el1 == el2)
		End If
	End Sub
End Module
```

```vb
Option Strict On
Option Explicit On

Module MyModule
	Sub Main()
		Dim i as Integer = 2, r as Integer = 1 
		If i = 3 AndAlso r = 1 Then 
			MsgBox("Not OK") ' equivalent of && 
		End If
		If i = 3 OrElse r = 1 Then
			Console.WriteLine("OK") ' equivalent of ||
		Else
			Console.WriteLine("Not OK")
		End If
	End Sub
End Module
```
### Switch case
---
The operations for comparisons are really similar to the other ones, if not the same and the there is the switch case:

```vb
Option Strict On
Option Explicit On

Module MyModule
	Sub Main()
		Dim month as Integer = 2, days as Integer  
		
		Select Case month
			Case 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12
				days = 31
			Case 4, 6, 9, 11
				days = 30
			Case 2 
				days 28
			Case Else
				Throw New Exception("Problemo")	
		End Select
		Console.WriteLine(days)
	End Sub
End Module
```
### Loops
---
The while loop instead is really similar but the condition has no parenthesis or curly brackets. The for loop is also really similar but the step is at the end of the code to execute:

```vb
Module MyModule
	Sub Main()
		Dim sum As Integer = 0
		For i as Integer = 1 To 10
			sum += 1
		Next i ' this is the i++
		For i as Integer = 0 To 19 Step 2
			sum += 1
		Next ' or you cound define the step above
	End Sub
End Module
```

A curiosity is the fact that in VB, not sure though, there is no way of setting the condition to use `<`, the `To` instruction is actually `<=`.
### Arrays
----
The only difference in arrays in VB is the fact that, since there are no squared brackets, they use normal parenthesis, other than that they work similarly, if not the same.

>[!WARNING]
> The number of elements you define in the array is going to be the last index of the array, so unlike other languages, `arr[10]` should have 10 elements: 0 to 9. In VB `arr(10)` is going to create an array of 11 elements: 0 to 10
### Procedures and Functions
---
The difference between procedures and function is the fact that:
- procedures do not return values, so they are practically used as void functions
- functions, instead are the normal functions that we know about, but they are forced to return one or more values

```vb
' procedure (sub)
Option Strict On
Option Explicit On
Module ArrayDemo

    Sub Sum(ByVal table() As Integer, ByRef result as Integer) 
      result = 0
      For i as Integer = 0 To 9
        result += table(i)
      Next
    End Sub

    Sub Main()
      Dim someNumbers(9) as Integer  
      Dim theSum as Integer = 0

      For i as Integer = 0 To 9
        someNumbers(i) = i * i
      Next
      Sum(someNumbers, theSum)
      Console.WriteLine(theSum)
    End Sub

End Module
```

```vb
' Function
Option Strict On
Option Explicit On
Module ArrayDemo

    Function Sum(ByVal table() As Integer) as Integer
      Dim result as Integer = 0 
      For i as Integer = 0 To 9
        result += table(i)
      Next
      return result
    End Function

    Sub Main()
      Dim someNumbers(9) as Integer  
      Dim theSum as Integer = 0
      For i as Integer = 0 To 9
        someNumbers(i) = i * i
      Next
      theSum = Sum(someNumbers)
	  Console.WriteLine(theSum)
    End Sub

End Module
```
### Classes and Objects
--- 
Practically the same but with the differences specified above, but the constructor is:

```vb
Public Class DataPaths
	' ...
	Public Sub New()
		' ...
	End Sub
End Class
```

And there is no `this` keyword.

>[!WARNING]
>THERE ARE NO SPECIAL CHARACTERS WITH '\\' IN STRINGS TO OUTPUT

>[!NOTE]
>In order to assign specifically a value to a char variable you need to add 'c' at the end since the ('') are for comments:
>`Dim c as Char = "a"c`
